# XBITS-HTLC Execution Procedure
* This section explains how XBITS will setup HTLC transactions on the bitshares blockchain
N/B HTLC is still a sensitive feature and users are warned not to transact business in XBITS.ASSETS with another user account but XBITS.

Procedure

Step 1: user request for BTS or XBITS.ASSETS deposit at (agreed) charge set by XBITS.

Step 2: XBITS ask for user's account name on the bitshares blockchain (user must be registered on wallet.bitshares.org to be able to perform this transaction)

Step 3: XBITS initiate HTLC for user BTS account provided and keeps the preimagexxxxxxSHA secret until cash/crypto deposit is made.

Step 4: XBITS releases preimagexxxxxxSHA to user to redeem the deposit on the bitshares blockchain via memo transaction of 1BTS.

Step 5: user goes to wallet.bitshares.org (there are many other BTS wallets)

Step 6: user go to spotlight=>HTLC on the dashboard

Step 7: user inputs preimagexxxxxxSHA on provided column after clicking the redeem tab button

Step 8: user confirms the transaction.. (new users will be issued approximately 10BTS to facilitate the payment of fees)

# Transaction Clog
XBITS is limited as it is not operated automatically so users are advised to excercise patience when dealing with XBITS.
XBITS will deal with users on a first come basis. To avoid clog the transaction ID of each transaction will be posted on the "HTLC records" repository
Users can also check up their transactions on the blockchain explorer bts.ai, cryptofresh.com or https://bts.ai https://wallet.bitshares.org/#/explorer/blocks.

# Withdrawals
XBITS does not perform withdrawals, the account owner is the one responsible for withdrawals, however for transparency, all user withdrawals will be sent XBITS.
Step 1: user initiate withdrawal via HTLC or memo of 1bts. (N/B if you do not understand how HTLC works stick with memo.)

Step 2: XBITS owner acknowledge the order via memo of 1bts

Step 3: user then sends withdrawal amount with bank txn details and preimagexxxxxxSHA in memo (if you sent memo initially all the details should be included so skip this step)

Step 4: XBITS owner pays the requested amount into bank details given via whatever means he chooses, i.e cash or online deposit service after redeeming the HTLC or receiving the withdrawal order

Step 5: XBITS owner will then send proof of deposit in memo.
# Liquidity
XBITS recognize that liquidity on the DEX is an issue thus users who wish to trade or who are already used to the bitshares ecosystem may be given BTS instead of XBITS.NGN
The resulting BTS will then be used to buy XBITS.NGN on the DEX.
