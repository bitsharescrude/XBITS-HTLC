# XBITS-HTLC Execution Procedure
* This section explains how XBITS will setup HTLC transactions on the bitshares blockchain
N/B HTLC is still a sensitive feature and users are warned not to transact business in XBITS.ASSETS with another user account but XBITS.

Procedure

Step 1: user request for BTS or XBITS.ASSETS deposit at (agreed) charge set by XBITS.

Step 2: XBITS ask for user's account name on the bitshares blockchain (user must be registered on wallet.bitshares.org to be able to perform this transaction)

Step 3: XBITS initiate HTLC for user BTS account provided and keeps the preimagexxxxxxSHA secret until cash/crypto deposit is made.

Step 4: XBITS releases preimagexxxxxxSHA to user to redeem the deposit on the bitshares blockchain via memo transaction of 1BTS.

Step 5: user goes to wallet.bitshares.org (there are many other BTS wallets)

Step 6: user go to spotlight=>HTLC on the dashboard

Step 7: user inputs preimagexxxxxxSHA on provided column after clicking the redeem tab button

Step 8: user confirms the transaction.. (new users will be issued approximately 10BTS to facilitate the payment of fees)

# Transaction Clog
XBITS is limited as it is not operated automatically so users are advised to excercise patience when dealing with XBITS.
XBITS will deal with users on a first come basis. To avoid clog the transaction ID of each transaction will be posted on the "HTLC records" repository
Users can also check up their transactions on the blockchain explorer bts.ai, cryptofresh.com or wallet.bitshares.org/explorer/.
